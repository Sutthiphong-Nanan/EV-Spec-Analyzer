### What does `find_stop_power_max` do?

#### Simple Explanation
In essence, the program answers the question:  
**"If a vehicle stops at a point on the route and accelerates, which starting position requires the greatest peak power?"**  
The output provides the specific location (distance) and the maximum power needed when accelerating from that point.

#### Example Scenario
Consider a route with two positions:  
- **Position 100 meters:** The vehicle stops and accelerates on a flat road, reaching a peak power of **500 watts** during acceleration.  
- **Position 200 meters:** The vehicle stops and accelerates uphill, reaching a peak power of **1,200 watts** during acceleration.  

The programâ€™s conclusion would be:  
- The most demanding position is **200 meters**, where the vehicle requires a peak power of **1,200 watts** when accelerating from a stop.
